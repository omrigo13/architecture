the purpose of distances printed in the point_at function
is to see how much space of bytes allocated for every variable and
for example addr6 and addr5 are global ints in the same area and because int is 4 bytes
the dist is 4
the other dists are larger because of other areas of variables storing like local in main or functions area

addr6 - global variables
addr5 - global variables
local - local variables
foo - global functions
