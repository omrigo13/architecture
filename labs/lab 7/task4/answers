digit_cnt starts at 00000577 and its size is 1136 on ntsc file
digit_cnt starts at 0000056d and its size is 80 on digitCounter file

the whole file size of ntsc is 7320 bytes

the whole file size of digitCounter is 9260 bytes


guide to fix ntsc:

1. run hexeditplus and choose 1 to set file as digitCounter (the compiled code i wrote)
2. set unit size to 1 byte in option 2
3. load into memory with option 3 with location: 56d and length 80
4. set file to ntsc with option 1
5. set again to 1 byte on option 2
6. save into file with option 6 with source address: 0, target location: 577, length: 1136
7. run ntsc and check if its ok now
