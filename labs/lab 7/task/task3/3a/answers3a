main can be found on abc file in offset 65 (file location), starts at address 08048464, section number 13
the main function size is 175

section 13 is the .text
Addr = 080483b0
Offset = 0003b0
size = 00020c

addresses diff = 08048464 - 080483b0 = 134513764 - 134513584 = 180 = B4

offset = 3b0 + b4 = 464

should run the hexeditplus and then load 175 bytes starting from 464 and then display them
